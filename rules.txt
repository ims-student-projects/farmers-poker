Farmer's Poker Rules

Farmer's Poker, also known as Farmer's Bridge is a trick-taking card game.
The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible over multiple rounds by correctly guessing the amount of tricks you will obtain in one round.
A trick is created by players playing a card on the table in turn order. Once every player has played one card, the player who played the card with the highest value obtains the trick.
Each round one of the suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs or spades) is selected as the trump. Cards with the trump suit always have a higher value than cards without the trump suit.
Cards without the trump suit and without the suit of the first card played in the trick do not have value (i.e. you cannot take a trick with them).
If there are multiple card with the same suit in one trick, then which one has the higher value depends on the value on the card, i.e. ace>king>queen>jack>10>9>8>7.
Cards with a value less than 7 are not used in this game.

At the start of the game a turn order is created. At the start of the first round, the first player in turn order makes a prediction first. In every subsequent round the player next in turn order to the one that made the first prediction in the previous round makes the first prediction in that round.
